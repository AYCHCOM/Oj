- next
 - unicode
  - remove option for encoding, always make UTF-8
   - later allow utf-16
   - keep ascii-only but make default - this is rcf compliant
    - maybe change the name to 'unicode' or reverse it to allow-high-bits
    - 
  - change encoding to be unicode
   - use utf-16 surrogate pairs for extended
   - size logic
    - if character has hi bit set
     - size is number of bits set
      - skip that many characters unless one of them is 0 or exceed length
  - 
    

 - setup travis to run tests
  - make sure time handles nsec instead of usec

- stream
 - use with Oj::Doc
 - use with standard
 - add callback SAX like option
  - callback parser
   - object_start
   - object_end
   - array_start
   - array_end
   - value
   - key

   - default callbacks use straight C and create Hash or Object according to mode
    - callback object
    - check respond_to? for each method at start
    - methods to indicate that defaults should be used instead of ignored
     - use_default_hash_callback?
     - use_default_array_callback?
     - use_default_key_callback?
     - use_default_value_callback?
    - or maybe
     - hash_callback? returns nil, :default, :my_hash_callback
      - default is to check hash_start and hash_end and no nothing if they do not exist
      - 

  - dump
   - support stream as arg
   - always dump to stream/file if possible (check performance)
