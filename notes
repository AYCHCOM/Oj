- odd
 - add array of C function pointers
  - use those to get the value from the object
   - for DateTime.sec
    - get sec and add to sec_fraction.to_f

- rbx test
 - get latest
- timezone in object time
 - object.c
  - hat_num


- add hash_key to scp
 - update sparse

 - call from sparse and parse
 - scp.c - implement hash_key()
  - call hash_key and set key_val, don't set key


- streaming parser for scp and saj


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
