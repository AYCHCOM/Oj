- debian

- use File class in reader, and other parsers

- ~# should be okay

 echo "[-1,0,1]" | ruby -r oj -e 'p Oj.load(STDIN)'
-e:1:in `pos': Illegal seek @ rb_io_tell - <STDIN> (Errno::ESPIPE)

- maybe check class for io, if File then ..., else pipe
- streaming parser for scp and saj


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
