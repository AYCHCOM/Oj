- next

 - circular reference
  - change ref to ^r1234
  - handle array element with "^i222" that is not an id
  - handle value that is "^r222" that is not a reference

  - use escaped to put ^ in strings instead of {"^s":"^foo"}
   - \u005e
  - use escaped to put : in strings instead of {"^s":":foo"}
   - \u003a

  - try simple array for dump
   - might be faster for small numbers of circular references which is the common case

  - compare circular
   - yajl - core dumps ruby
   - json fails
   - msgpack fails


- format
 - escape ^ when reading and convert immediately to alternate sequences
 - ^t12345.67890 for time value instead of hash?
  - number is more natural for comatibility
 - ^r12345 for references
 - \: for symbol or reverse vs string
 - ^i123 for array id



 - stream
  - load
  - dump

- load

- dump
 - multibyte group encoding
 - object and other types of object dumping


- support circular object encoding
