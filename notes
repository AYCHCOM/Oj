- Writer
 - methods
  - new
   - new() for StringWriter
   - new(io) for StreamWriter
  - push_object(key=nil)
  - push_array(key=nil)
  - pop
  - push_value(value, key=nil)
  - pop_all (closes all open objects or array)
  - to_s (for StringWiter)

 - options same as dump
 - keep track of nesting
 - calls into a writer
  - write to string function or write to stream
  - get string, return nil if stream


 - StreamWriter
  - new(stream) optional stream, if nil then write to string buffer
 - StringWriter
  - to_s
   - return string if 


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is 10% to 15% of the total so splitting
ruby calls and c does not help much and the overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby
calls into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object creation.
