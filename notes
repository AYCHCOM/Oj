- time
 - object.c hat_num()
  - for 1.8.7 have to create string and then call parse, not xmlschema (xmlschema always makes UTC)
  - for 1.9 and above use Time.new()
  - use oj_parse_id, not intern
 - test
  - check number parsing for big exp
  - times with different zones - check string also


- streaming parser for scp and saj


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
