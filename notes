^c^d hide subtree
^c^s show subtree

- parser
 - if block given then call that after parsing
  - at bottom of parse2, check for stack empty or something
  - maybe when stack head replaced and also on return


- built in support for primitive subclasses
 - not supported
  - Bignum subclass
  - Regexp subclass
  - Time subclass 
 - supported
  - String
  - Array
  - Hash
 - implementation
  - store primitive value in 'this' element
   - on load, if this encountered, use :replace to replace contents
  - dump changes
   - for special, check real class
  - load changes for 'this' only



 - StreamWriter
  - new(stream) optional stream, if nil then write to string buffer
 - StringWriter
  - to_s
   - return string if 



---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
