## <a name="release">Release Notes</a>

### Release 0.9.0

- Added support for circular references.

## <a name="description">Description</a>

Optimized JSON (Oj), as the name implies was written to provide speed
optimized JSON handling. It was designed as a faster alternative to Yajl and
other the common Ruby JSON parsers. So far is has achieved that at about 2
time faster than Yajl for parsing and 3 or more times faster writing JSON.

Oj has several dump or serialization modes which control how Objects are
converted to JSON. These modes are set with the :effort option in either the
default options or as one of the options to the dump() method.

- :strict mode will only allow the 7 basic JSON types to be serialized. Any other Object
will raise and Exception. 

- :null mode replaces any Object that is not one of the JSON types is replaced by a JSON null.

- :object mode will dump any Object as a JSON Object with keys that match the
Ruby Object's variable names without the '@' character. This is the highest
performance mode.

- :compat mode is is the compatible with other systems. It will serialize any
Object but will check to see if the Object implements a to_hash() or to_json()
method. If either exists that method is used for serializing the Object. The
to_hash() is more flexible and produces more consistent output so it has a
preference over the to_json() method. If neither the to_json() or to_hash()
methods exist then the Oj internal Object variable encoding is used.

Oj is compatible with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, JRuby, and RBX.

## <a name="plans">Planned Releases</a>

- Release 1.0: A JSON stream parser.

## <a name="compare">Comparisons</a>

The following table shows the difference is speeds between several
serialization packages. The tests had to be scaled back due to limitation of
some of the gems. I finally gave up trying to get JSON Pure to serialize
without errors with Ruby 1.9.3. It had internal errors on anything other than
a simple JSON structure. The errors encountered were:

- MessagePack fails to convert Bignum to JSON

- JSON Pure fails to serialize any numbers or Objects with the to_json() method

Options were added to the test/perf_strict.rb test to run the test without
Object encoding and without Bignums.

None of the packages except Oj were able to serialize Ruby Objects that did
not have a to_json() method or were of the 7 native JSON types.

A perf_obj.rb file was added for comparing different Object marshalling
packages.

It is also worth noting that although Oj is slightly behind MessagePack for
parsing, Oj serialization is much faster than MessagePack even though Oj uses
human readable JSON vs the binary MessagePack format.

UOj supports circular references when in :object mode and when the :circular
flag is true. None of the other gems tested supported circular
references. They failed in the following manners when the input included
circular references.

 - Yajl core dumps Ruby

 - JSON fails and raises an Exception

 - MessagePack fails and raises an Exception

The benchmark results are:

with Object and Bignum encoding:

    MessagePack failed to pack! RangeError: bignum too big to convert into `unsigned long long'.
    Skipping.

### Simple JSON Writing and Parsing:

    require 'oj'
    
    h = { 'one' => 1, 'array' => [ true, false ] }
    json = Oj.dump(h)
    
    # json =
    # {
    #   "one":1,
    #   "array":[
    #     true,
    #     false
    #   ]
    # }

    h2 = Oj.parse(json)
    puts "Same? #{h == h2}"
    # true

### Object JSON format:

In :object mode Oj generates JSON that follows conventions which allow Class
and other information such as Object IDs for circular reference detection. The
formating follows the following rules.

1. JSON native types, true, false, nil, String, Hash, Array, and Number are
encoded normally.

2. A Symbol is encoded as a JSON string with a preceeding `:` character.

3. The `^` character denotes a special key value when in a JSON Object sequence.

4. A Ruby String that starts with `:` or the sequence `^i` or `^r` are encoded by
excaping the first character so that it appears as `\u005e` or `\u003a` instead of
`:` or `^`.

5. A `"^c"` JSON Object key indicates the value should be converted to a Ruby
class. The sequence `{"^c":"Oj::Bag"}` is read as the Oj::Bag class.

6. A `"^t"` JSON Object key indicates the value should be converted to a Ruby
Time. The sequence `{"^t":1325775487.000000}` is read as Jan 5, 2012 at 23:58:07.

87. A `"^o"` JSON Object key indicates the value should be converted to a Ruby
Object. The first entry in the JSON Object must be a class with the `"^o"`
key. After that each entry is treated as a variable of the Object where the
key is the variable name without the preceeding `@`. An example is
`{"^o":"Oj::Bag","x":58,"y":"marbles"}`.

8. A `"^u"` JSON Object key indicates the value should be converted to a Ruby
Struct. The first entry in the JSON Object must be a class with the `"^u"`
key. After that each entry is is given a numeric position in the struct and
that is used as the key in the JSON Object. An example is `{"^u":["Range",1,7,false]}`.

9. When encoding an Object, if the variable name does not begin with an `@`
character then the name preceeded by a `~` character. This occurs in the
Exception class. An example is `{"^o":"StandardError","~mesg":"A Message","~bt":[".\/tests.rb:345:in `test_exception'"]}`.

10. If a Hash entry has a key that is not a String or Symbol then the entry is
encoded with a key of the form `"^#n"` where n is a hex number. The value that
is an Array where the first element is the key in the Hash and the second is
the value. An example is `{"^#3":[2,5]}`.

11. A `"^i"` JSON entry in either an Object or Array is the ID of the Ruby
Object being encoded. It is used when the :circular flag is set. It can appear
in either a JSON Object or in a JSON Array. In an Object the `"^i"` key has a
corresponding reference Fixnum. In an array the sequence will include an
embedded reference number. An example is
`{"^o":"Oj::Bag","^i":1,"x":["^i2",true],"me":"^r1"}`.

12. A `"^r"` JSON entry in an Object is a references to a Object or Array that
already appears in the JSON String. It must match up with a previous `"^i"`
ID. An example is `{"^o":"Oj::Bag","^i":1,"x":3,"me":"^r1"}`.

13. If an Array element is a String and starts with `"^i"` then the first
character, the `^` is encoded as a hex character sequence. An example is
`["\u005ei37",3]`.
